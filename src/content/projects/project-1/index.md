Web application where you can register your ferret to an exhibition. For ferret exhibition organizers they can create their own exhibition, fill in all the details and people can also already pay to you. At a date of the show judging and scoring including final result calculations is done so no need for sheets of paper or excel sheets anymore.

Done it in Next.js out of curiosity to try this tech everybody talked, at the time, as a usefull tool for my wife and ferret enthusiasts.
